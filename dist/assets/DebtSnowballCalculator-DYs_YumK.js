When the smallest debt is paid off, its minimum payment "rolls" into the next smallest debt, creating a snowball effect. This method prioritizes psychological wins to keep you motivated.'},{question:"What is the debt avalanche method?",answer:"The debt avalanche method (also called debt stacking) focuses on paying off debts with the highest interest rates first, regardless of balance. While this approach saves more money in total interest, it may take longer to see your first debt fully paid off, which can be less motivating for some people."},{question:"Which is better — snowball or avalanche?",answer:"Mathematically, the avalanche method always saves more in interest. However, behavioral research shows that the psychological boost from paying off small debts quickly (snowball) helps many people stay committed to their payoff plan. The best method is the one you'll stick with. Our calculator shows both so you can compare."},{question:"How much extra should I put toward debt?",answer:"Any extra amount helps, but a common guideline is to use the 50/30/20 budget rule: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and debt repayment. If you're aggressively paying off debt, you might temporarily shift to 50/20/30 (allocating more to debt). Even an extra $100/month can save thousands in interest."},{question:"Should I pay off debt or invest?",answer:"Generally, if your debt interest rate is higher than your expected investment return, prioritize debt payoff. For example, paying off a 20% credit card is equivalent to earning a guaranteed 20% return. However, always contribute enough to get any employer 401(k) match first (it's free money). For low-interest debt (under 5%), investing may be more beneficial long-term."},{question:"Should I have an emergency fund before starting?",answer:'Yes. Most financial experts recommend saving a "starter" emergency fund of $1,000 to $2,000 before aggressively paying off debt. This ensures that a car repair or medical bill doesn’t force you back into high-interest credit card debt while you are in the middle of your payoff plan.'},{question:"Does debt consolidation help?",answer:"Debt consolidation — taking out one large loan to pay off multiple smaller ones — can help if the new loan has a significantly lower interest rate and if you stop using the credit cards you just paid off. Without a change in spending habits, consolidation often leads to even more debt."},{question:'What is "0% APR Balance Transfer"?',answer:'This is a credit card offer that allows you to move your debt to a new card with 0% interest for a set period (usually 12-21 months). This is a powerful tool to pause interest and pay down principal, but be aware of "transfer fees" (usually 3-5%) and ensure you pay it off before the promotion ends.'},{question:"How do extra payments impact the timeline?",answer:'Because credit card interest is calculated daily or monthly based on your balance, paying even a small extra amount early in the month reduces the principal that interest is calculated on. This "compound interest in reverse" can shave years off your timeline.'},{question:"What happens to my credit score as I pay off debt?",answer:'As your "credit utilization ratio" (the amount of credit you are using vs. your total limit) decreases, your credit score typically increases. A utilization below 30% is considered good, and below 10% is excellent.'},{question:"Does closing credit cards after paying them off help?",answer:"Generally, no. Closing credit cards can hurt your credit score by reducing your total available credit (increasing your credit utilization ratio) and shortening your average account age. It's usually better to keep the cards open and use them occasionally for small purchases that you pay off immediately."}],X=[{name:"Credit Card",balance:5e3,rate:22.99,minPayment:150},{name:"Car Loan",balance:15e3,rate:6.5,minPayment:350},{name:"Student Loan",balance:25e3,rate:5,minPayment:280}];function se(){const{formatCurrency:s}=M(),[r,d]=i.useState(X),[u,b]=i.useState(200),[a,p]=i.useState(null),[m,w]=i.useState(!0),[S,f]=i.useState(!1),g=i.useRef(null),k=()=>{navigator.clipboard.writeText(window.location.href),f(!0),setTimeout(()=>f(!1),2e3)},C=()=>{d([{name:"Credit Card",balance:8500,rate:24.99,minPayment:200},{name:"Personal Loan",balance:12e3,rate:11.5,minPayment:300},{name:"Car Loan",balance:18e3,rate:5.9,minPayment:400},{name:"Student Loan",balance:35e3,rate:4.5,minPayment:350}]),b(500),p(null)},T=t=>{t.preventDefault();const n=r.filter(l=>l.balance>0&&l.minPayment>0),o=R(n,parseFloat(u));if(o.error){alert(o.error);return}p(o),setTimeout(()=>g.current?.scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth",block:"start"}),100)},h=(t,n,o)=>{const l=[...r];if(n==="name")l[t]={...l[t],name:o};else{const v=String(o).replace(/[^0-9.]/g,""),y=v.split("."),B=y.length>2?y[0]+"."+y.slice(1).join(""):v;l[t]={...l[t],[n]:parseFloat(B)||0}}d(l)},P=()=>{d([...r,{name:`Debt ${r.length+1}`,balance:0,rate:0,minPayment:0}])},D=t=>{r.length<=1||d(r.filter((n,o)=>o!==t))},x=r.reduce((t,n)=>t+(n.balance||0),0);r.reduce((t,n)=>t+(n.minPayment||0),0);const N=()=>{a&&J("Debt Payoff Strategy",[{label:"Total Debt",value:s(x)},{label:"Extra Monthly Payment",value:s(u)},{label:"Snowball Payoff Time",value:c(a.snowball.totalMonths)},{label:"Snowball Interest",value:s(a.snowball.totalInterest)},{label:"Avalanche Payoff Time",value:c(a.avalanche.totalMonths)},{label:"Avalanche Interest",value:s(a.avalanche.totalInterest)},{label:"Interest Saved (Snowball)",value:s(a.interestSavedSnowball)},{label:"Interest Saved (Avalanche)",value:s(a.interestSavedAvalanche)}],null,null)},z=a?{labels:a.snowball.timeline.map(t=>`Month ${t.month}`),datasets:[{label:"Snowball Method",data:a.snowball.timeline.map(t=>t.totalBalance),borderColor:"#2563eb",backgroundColor:"rgba(37, 99, 235, 0.05)",fill:!1,tension:.3,pointRadius:4},{label:"Avalanche Method",data:a.avalanche.timeline.map(t=>t.totalBalance),borderColor:"#059669",backgroundColor:"rgba(5, 150, 105, 0.05)",fill:!1,tension:.3,pointRadius:4},...m?[{label:"Minimum Payments Only",data:a.minimumOnly.timeline.map(t=>t.totalBalance),borderColor:"#dc2626",backgroundColor:"rgba(220, 38, 38, 0.05)",fill:!1,tension:.3,pointRadius:4,borderDash:[5,5]}]:[]]}:null;return e.jsxs("div",{className:"calculator-page",children:[e.jsx(V,{title:"Debt Snowball Calculator — Optimize Your Debt Payoff Strategy",description:"Compare snowball vs. avalanche debt payoff methods.
