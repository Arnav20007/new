When inflation occurs, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money."},{question:"How does inflation affect my savings?",answer:"If your savings earn less interest than the inflation rate, your money loses purchasing power over time. For example, if you have 2% interest on your savings but inflation is 3%, you are effectively losing 1% of your wealth every year."},{question:"What has the historical inflation rate been?",answer:"In the United States, inflation has averaged about 3.2% per year over the past century. However, this has fluctuated from negative (deflation) in the 1930s to over 13% in the late 1970s."},{question:"How can I protect my money from inflation?",answer:"Traditional hedges include Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), real estate, and stocks. Companies can often raise prices to match inflation, allowing their stock price to keep pace, whereas cash in a mattress simply loses value."},{question:"What is the CPI?",answer:"The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. It is the most widely used measure of inflation."},{question:'What is "Hyperinflation"?',answer:"Hyperinflation is a term used to describe rapid, excessive, and out-of-control general price increases in an economy. While regular inflation is measured in terms of monthly price increases, hyperinflation is typically defined as inflation exceeding 50% per month."},{question:"Does inflation affect debt?",answer:'In a way, inflation can be good for borrowers. If you have a fixed-rate loan (like a 30-year mortgage), you are paying back the debt with "cheaper" dollars over time. However, it is bad for lenders for the same reason.'},{question:'What is the "Wage-Price Spiral"?',answer:"This is an economic phenomenon where rising prices lead workers to demand higher wages, which then increases production costs for companies, causing them to raise prices even further, creating a continuous loop."},{question:"How do central banks control inflation?",answer:'Central banks, like the Federal Reserve, typically control inflation by adjusting interest rates. When inflation is too high, they raise interest rates to slow down spending and "cool" the economy.'},{question:"How does inflation impact retirement planning?",answer:"Inflation makes future expenses higher. If you plan to retire in 30 years, a $5,000 monthly lifestyle today could easily cost $12,000 to $15,000 per month by the time you stop working. This is why investing for growth is critical."}],ne={currentValue:{label:"Current Value",min:1,max:1e8,required:!0},years:{label:"Time
