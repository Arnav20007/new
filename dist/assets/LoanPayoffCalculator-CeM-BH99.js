Each month, the interest charge equals the outstanding balance multiplied by the monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12)."},{question:"Should I make extra payments on my loan?",answer:"Making extra payments can significantly reduce the total interest paid and the loan duration. Even small additional amounts applied to principal each month can save thousands over the life of a loan."},{question:"What is the difference between APR and interest rate?",answer:"The interest rate is the cost of borrowing the principal amount. The APR includes the interest rate plus other costs like origination fees, closing costs, and insurance."},{question:"How do I calculate my minimum monthly payment?",answer:"For a standard amortizing loan, the minimum payment is calculated using the formula: M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n-1], where P is the principal, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments."},{question:"What are prepayment penalties?",answer:"A prepayment penalty is a fee charged by some lenders if you pay off all or part of your loan significantly earlier than the agreed-upon term. Most modern mortgages and auto loans do not have these, but you should always check your loan agreement before making large extra payments."},{question:"Is it better to pay off my mortgage or invest the extra cash?",answer:'This depends on your loan’s interest rate versus your expected investment return. If your mortgage rate is 3% and the stock market returns 7-10%, investing might be mathematically better. However, paying off debt provides a "guaranteed" return equal to the interest rate and significant peace of mind.'},{question:"How do bi-weekly payments work?",answer:"Bi-weekly payments involve making half your monthly payment every two weeks. Because there are 52 weeks in a year, you end up making 26 half-payments, which equals 13 full payments instead of the usual 12. This simple switch can shave years off a 30-year mortgage."},{question:"Can I change my loan term mid-way?",answer:"Typically, you cannot change the term of your current contract without refinancing. However, by making extra payments as shown in our calculator, you effectively shorten the term yourself without having to pay for a new loan origination."},{question:"What happens if I miss a loan payment?",answer:'Missing a payment can lead to late fees, an increase in your interest rate (if it’s a variable or penalty-based loan), and significant damage to your credit score. If you’re struggling, contact your lender immediately to discuss "forbearance" or "deferment" options.'},{question:"Is this calculator suitable for mortgage calculations?",answer:"Yes, this calculator works for any fixed-rate amortizing loan including mortgages, auto loans, personal loans, and student loans."}],le={amount:{label:"Loan Amount",min:1,max:1e8,required:!0},rate:{label:"Interest Rate",min:.1,max:50,allowDecimal:!0,required:!0},payment:{label:"Monthly Payment",min:1,max:1e7,required:!0}};function fe(){const{formatCurrency:t,symbol:r}=$(),{values:l,errors:m,touched:u,handleChange:y,handleBlur:p,validateAll:I,getNumericValue:s,setValues:T}=re({amount:"250000",rate:"6.5",payment:"2000"},le),[n,f]=o.useState(null),[j,g]=o.useState(""),[i,S]=o.useState(!1),[h,B]=o.useState("2500"),[c,v]=o.useState(null),[R,w]=o.useState(!1),k=o.useRef(null),M=()=>{navigator.clipboard.writeText(window.location.href),w(!0),setTimeout(()=>w(!1),2e3)},A=()=>{T({amount:"350000",rate:"7.25",payment:"2500"}),f(null),g("")},L=a=>{if(a.preventDefault(),g(""),!I())return;const x=P(s("amount"),s("rate"),s("payment"));if(x.error){g(x.error),f(null);return}if(f(x),i){const C=P(s("amount"),s("rate"),parseFloat(h)||0);v(C.error?null:C)}setTimeout(()=>k.current?.scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth",block:"start"}),100)},W=()=>{n&&se("Loan Payoff Schedule",[{label:"Loan Amount",value:t(s("amount"))},{label:"Interest Rate",value:`${l.rate}%`},{label:"Monthly Payment",value:t(s("payment"))},{label:"Payoff Time",value:d(n.totalMonths)},{label:"Total Interest Paid",value:t(n.totalInterest)},{label:"Total Amount Paid",value:t(n.totalPayments)}],n.annualSummary,[{header:"Year",accessor:a=>a.year},{header:"Payments",accessor:a=>t(a.totalPayments)},{header:"Principal",accessor:a=>t(a.totalPrincipal)},{header:"Interest",accessor:a=>t(a.totalInterest)},{header:"Remaining",accessor:a=>t(a.endBalance)}])},q={responsive:!0,maintainAspectRatio:!1,plugins:{legend:{position:"top",labels:{color:"#94a3b8",padding:16,usePointStyle:!0}},tooltip:{backgroundColor:"rgba(15, 22, 41, 0.95)",titleColor:"#f1f5f9",bodyColor:"#94a3b8",borderColor:"rgba(255,255,255,0.1)",borderWidth:1,padding:12,cornerRadius:8,callbacks:{label:a=>`${a.dataset.label}: ${t(a.raw)}`}}},scales:{y:{ticks:{callback:a=>t(a),color:"#64748b"},grid:{color:"rgba(255,255,255,0.04)"},border:{color:"transparent"}},x:{grid:{display:!1},ticks:{color:"#64748b"},border:{color:"transparent"}}}},D=n?{labels:n.annualSummary.map(a=>`Year ${a.year}`),datasets:[{label:"Remaining Balance",data:n.annualSummary.map(a=>a.endBalance),borderColor:"#ef4444",backgroundColor:"rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.08)",fill:!0,tension:.4,pointRadius:4,pointBackgroundColor:"#ef4444"},...i&&c?[{label:`Scenario B (${r}${h}/mo)`,data:c.annualSummary.map(a=>a.endBalance),borderColor:"#8b5cf6",backgroundColor:"rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.05)",fill:!1,tension:.4,pointRadius:3,borderDash:[8,4],pointBackgroundColor:"#8b5cf6"}]:[]]}:null,z=n?{labels:["Principal","Total Interest"],datasets:[{data:[s("amount"),n.totalInterest],backgroundColor:["rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.6)","rgba(249, 115, 22, 0.6)"],borderColor:["rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.9)","rgba(249, 115, 22, 0.9)"],borderWidth:2}]}:null;return e.jsxs("div",{className:"calculator-page",children:[e.jsx(ae,{title:"Loan Payoff & Amortization Calculator India | FinanceCalc",description:"Calculate your loan payoff timeline with a complete amortization schedule and see how extra payments save you money on interest.
