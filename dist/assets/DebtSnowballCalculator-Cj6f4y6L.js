When the smallest debt is paid off, its minimum payment "rolls" into the next smallest debt, creating a snowball effect. This method prioritizes psychological wins to keep you motivated.'},{question:"What is the debt avalanche method?",answer:"The debt avalanche method (also called debt stacking) focuses on paying off debts with the highest interest rates first, regardless of balance. While this approach saves more money in total interest, it may take longer to see your first debt fully paid off, which can be less motivating for some people."},{question:"Which is better — snowball or avalanche?",answer:"Mathematically, the avalanche method always saves more in interest. However, behavioral research shows that the psychological boost from paying off small debts quickly (snowball) helps many people stay committed to their payoff plan. The best method is the one you'll stick with. Our calculator shows both so you can compare."},{question:"How much extra should I put toward debt?",answer:"Any extra amount helps, but a common guideline is to use the 50/30/20 budget rule: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and debt repayment. If you're aggressively paying off debt, you might temporarily shift to 50/20/30 (allocating more to debt). Even an extra $100/month can save thousands in interest."},{question:"Should I pay off debt or invest?",answer:"Generally, if your debt interest rate is higher than your expected investment return, prioritize debt payoff. For example, paying off a 20% credit card is equivalent to earning a guaranteed 20% return. However, always contribute enough to get any employer 401(k) match first (it's free money). For low-interest debt (under 5%), investing may be more beneficial long-term."},{question:"Does closing credit cards after paying them off help?",answer:"Generally, no. Closing credit cards can hurt your credit score by reducing your total available credit (increasing your credit utilization ratio) and shortening your average account age. It's usually better to keep the cards open and use them occasionally for small purchases that you pay off immediately."}],U=[{name:"Credit Card",balance:5e3,rate:22.99,minPayment:150},{name:"Car Loan",balance:15e3,rate:6.5,minPayment:350},{name:"Student Loan",balance:25e3,rate:5,minPayment:280}];function V(){const[o,m]=c.useState(U),[h,v]=c.useState(200),[a,x]=c.useState(null),b=c.useRef(null),j=t=>{t.preventDefault();const n=o.filter(r=>r.balance>0&&r.minPayment>0),s=A(n,parseFloat(h));if(s.error){alert(s.error);return}x(s),setTimeout(()=>b.current?.scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth",block:"start"}),100)},d=(t,n,s)=>{const r=[...o];if(n==="name")r[t]={...r[t],name:s};else{const y=String(s).replace(/[^0-9.]/g,""),u=y.split("."),P=u.length>2?u[0]+"."+u.slice(1).join(""):y;r[t]={...r[t],[n]:parseFloat(P)||0}}m(r)},w=()=>{m([...o,{name:`Debt ${o.length+1}`,balance:0,rate:0,minPayment:0}])},S=t=>{o.length<=1||m(o.filter((n,s)=>s!==t))},p=o.reduce((t,n)=>t+(n.balance||0),0);o.reduce((t,n)=>t+(n.minPayment||0),0);const C=()=>{a&&R("Debt Payoff Strategy",[{label:"Total Debt",value:l(p)},{label:"Extra Monthly Payment",value:l(h)},{label:"Snowball Payoff Time",value:i(a.snowball.totalMonths)},{label:"Snowball Interest",value:l(a.snowball.totalInterest)},{label:"Avalanche Payoff Time",value:i(a.avalanche.totalMonths)},{label:"Avalanche Interest",value:l(a.avalanche.totalInterest)},{label:"Interest Saved (Snowball)",value:l(a.interestSavedSnowball)},{label:"Interest Saved (Avalanche)",value:l(a.interestSavedAvalanche)}],null,null)},k=a?{labels:a.snowball.timeline.map(t=>`Month ${t.month}`),datasets:[{label:"Snowball Method",data:a.snowball.timeline.map(t=>t.totalBalance),borderColor:"#2563eb",backgroundColor:"rgba(37, 99, 235, 0.05)",fill:!1,tension:.3,pointRadius:4},{label:"Avalanche Method",data:a.avalanche.timeline.map(t=>t.totalBalance),borderColor:"#059669",backgroundColor:"rgba(5, 150, 105, 0.05)",fill:!1,tension:.3,pointRadius:4},{label:"Minimum Payments Only",data:a.minimumOnly.timeline.map(t=>t.totalBalance),borderColor:"#dc2626",backgroundColor:"rgba(220, 38, 38, 0.05)",fill:!1,tension:.3,pointRadius:4,borderDash:[5,5]}]}:null;return e.jsxs("div",{className:"calculator-page",children:[e.jsx(_,{title:"Debt Snowball Calculator — Optimize Your Debt Payoff Strategy",description:"Compare snowball vs. avalanche debt payoff methods.
