For example, if you need $50,000 annually, you would need a corpus of $1.25 million."},{question:"What is the 4% rule?",answer:"The 4% rule suggests that you can withdraw 4% of your retirement portfolio in the first year, then adjust that amount for inflation each subsequent year, and your money should last at least 30 years."},{question:"When should I start saving for retirement?",answer:"The best time to start saving for retirement is as early as possible. Thanks to compound interest, money invested in your 20s has significantly more time to grow than money invested in your 40s."},{question:"What rate of return should I assume?",answer:'For a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, a reasonable long-term assumption is 6-8% annually before inflation. If you want to see "today’s dollars," use a "real" rate of 4-5% (nominal rate minus inflation).'},{question:"How does Social Security factor in?",answer:"Social Security benefits provide a safety net but typically only replace about 40% of pre-retirement income. Our calculator focuses on your personal savings to bridge the gap and ensure a comfortable lifestyle."},{question:"Should I use a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA?",answer:"Traditional IRAs provide a tax break today (contributions are deductible), while Roth IRAs provide tax-free income tomorrow. If you think you will be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth is generally superior."},{question:'What is "Coast FIRE"?',answer:"Coast FIRE is the point where you have already saved enough in your retirement accounts that, even if you never contribute another cent, the balance will grow to your target retirement number by the time you reach retirement age because of compounding."},{question:"How do healthcare costs impact retirement?",answer:"Healthcare is one of the largest expenses in retirement. Fidelity estimates that an average 65-year-old couple may need $315,000 to cover healthcare costs in retirement, excluding long-term care. It’s wise to have a dedicated Health Savings Account (HSA) for this."},{question:'What is a "Catch-up Contribution"?',answer:'If you are age 50 or older, the IRS allows you to contribute extra money beyond the standard limits to your 401(k) and IRA. This is designed to help those who started late "catch up" on their savings goals.'},{question:"Does this calculator account for inflation?",answer:'Our calculator uses nominal values. To see your results in "inflation-adjusted" terms, subtract the expected inflation rate (usually 2-3%) from your expected investment return before inputting it.'},{question:"Can I retire early if I reach my number before age 65?",answer:'Yes! Reaching your "FI Number" (Financial Independence) means your assets generate enough income to cover your expenses. However, be aware of early withdrawal penalties (usually before age 59½) and plan your "bridge" strategy accordingly.'}],se={currentAge:{label:"Current Age",min:18,max:80,allowDecimal:!1,required:!0},retirementAge:{label:"Retirement Age",min:30,max:100,allowDecimal:!1,required:!0},currentSavings:{label:"Current Savings",min:0,max:1e8,required:!0},monthlyContribution:{label:"Monthly Contribution",min:0,max:1e6,required:!0},expectedReturn:{label:"Expected Return",min:0,max:30,allowDecimal:!0,required:!0},withdrawalRate:{label:"Withdrawal Rate",min:1,max:10,allowDecimal:!0,required:!0}};function me(){const{formatCurrency:r,symbol:i}=D(),{values:n,errors:l,touched:c,handleChange:u,handleBlur:d,validateAll:N,getNumericValue:o,setValues:A}=oe({currentAge:"30",retirementAge:"65",currentSavings:"50000",monthlyContribution:"1000",expectedReturn:"7",withdrawalRate:"4"},se),[a,p]=s.useState(null),[f,x]=s.useState(""),[h,I]=s.useState(!1),[y,S]=s.useState("2000"),[m,j]=s.useState(null),[T,v]=s.useState(!1),w=s.useRef(null),W=()=>{navigator.clipboard.writeText(window.location.href),v(!0),setTimeout(()=>v(!1),2e3)},P=()=>{A({currentAge:"28",retirementAge:"60",currentSavings:"75000",monthlyContribution:"1500",expectedReturn:"8",withdrawalRate:"4"}),p(null),x("")},E=t=>{if(t.preventDefault(),x(""),!N())return;const b=R(parseInt(n.currentAge),parseInt(n.retirementAge),o("currentSavings"),o("monthlyContribution"),o("expectedReturn"),o("withdrawalRate"));if(b.error){x(b.error),p(null);return}if(p(b),h){const C=R(parseInt(n.currentAge),parseInt(n.retirementAge),o("currentSavings"),parseFloat(y)||0,o("expectedReturn"),o("withdrawalRate"));j(C.error?null:C)}setTimeout(()=>w.current?.scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth",block:"start"}),100)},F=()=>{a&&ae("Retirement Projection",[{label:"Retirement Corpus",value:r(a.retirementCorpus)},{label:"Total Contributions",value:r(a.totalContributions)},{label:"Investment Growth",value:r(a.totalGrowth)},{label:"Annual Withdrawal",value:r(a.annualWithdrawal)},{label:"Monthly Withdrawal",value:r(a.monthlyWithdrawal)}],a.projection,[{header:"Age",accessor:t=>t.age},{header:"Balance",accessor:t=>r(t.balance)},{header:"Contributions",accessor:t=>r(t.totalContributions)},{header:"Growth",accessor:t=>r(t.yearlyGrowth)}])},B={responsive:!0,maintainAspectRatio:!1,plugins:{legend:{position:"top",labels:{color:"#94a3b8",padding:16,usePointStyle:!0}},tooltip:{backgroundColor:"rgba(15,22,41,0.95)",titleColor:"#f1f5f9",bodyColor:"#94a3b8",borderColor:"rgba(255,255,255,0.1)",borderWidth:1,padding:12,cornerRadius:8,callbacks:{label:t=>`${t.dataset.label}: ${r(t.raw)}`}}},scales:{y:{ticks:{callback:t=>r(t),color:"#64748b"},grid:{color:"rgba(255,255,255,0.04)"},border:{color:"transparent"}},x:{grid:{display:!1},ticks:{color:"#64748b"},border:{color:"transparent"}}}},q=a?{labels:a.projection.map(t=>`Age ${t.age}`),datasets:[{label:"Portfolio Value",data:a.projection.map(t=>t.balance),borderColor:"#10b981",backgroundColor:"rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.08)",fill:!0,tension:.4,pointRadius:2,pointBackgroundColor:"#10b981"},{label:"Total Contributions",data:a.projection.map(t=>t.totalContributions),borderColor:"#64748b",backgroundColor:"rgba(100,116,139,0.05)",fill:!0,tension:.4,pointRadius:2,borderDash:[5,5]},...h&&m?[{label:`Scenario B (${i}${y}/mo)`,data:m.projection.map(t=>t.balance),borderColor:"#8b5cf6",backgroundColor:"rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.05)",fill:!1,tension:.4,pointRadius:2,borderDash:[8,4],pointBackgroundColor:"#8b5cf6"}]:[]]}:null,M=a?{labels:["Contributions","Investment Growth"],datasets:[{data:[a.totalContributions,a.totalGrowth],backgroundColor:["rgba(100,116,139,0.3)","rgba(16,185,129,0.6)"],borderColor:["rgba(100,116,139,0.5)","rgba(16,185,129,0.9)"],borderWidth:2}]}:null;return e.jsxs("div",{className:"calculator-page",children:[e.jsx(te,{title:"Retirement Calculator — Plan Your Nest Egg | FinanceCalc",description:"Calculate how much you need to retire comfortably.
