Because interest is compounded daily or monthly, a small balance can grow very quickly if only minimum payments are made."},{question:'What is the "Minimum Payment Trap"?',answer:"Minimum payments are designed to keep you in debt for as long as possible. They usually only cover the interest and a tiny fraction of the principal. If you only pay the minimum, it could take decades to pay off even a small balance."},{question:"Should I pay off my highest interest card first?",answer:'Yes, this is known as the "Debt Avalanche" method. It saves you the most money in interest charges. However, some people prefer the "Snowball" method (smallest balance first) for the psychological win.'},{question:"Can I negotiate my interest rate?",answer:"Yes! If you have a good payment history, you can call your card issuer and ask for a lower APR. Even a 2-3% reduction can save you significant money over time."},{question:"What is a Balance Transfer?",answer:"A balance transfer allows you to move debt from a high-interest card to a new card with a 0% introductory APR (usually for 12-18 months).
